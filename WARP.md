# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a curated collection of well-written tutorials for building technologies from scratch. It's a knowledge repository, not a traditional software project - there's no code to build, test, or run.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Main content file containing all categorized tutorial links
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` - Template for submitting new tutorials
- `.gitattributes` - Treats Markdown files as code (not documentation) for GitHub linguist

## Working with This Repository

### Adding New Tutorials

1. Check `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` for submission requirements
2. Tutorials must be:
   - Step-by-step guides or digestible code breakdowns
   - Building something interesting from scratch
   - Not just framework guides or library glue code
3. Edit `README.md` and add the tutorial under the appropriate category
4. Format: `* [**Language**: _Tutorial Title_](URL)`
5. Keep alphabetical order within language sections

### Categories

The repository is organized by what you're building:
- 3D Renderer, Augmented Reality, BitTorrent Client
- Blockchain/Cryptocurrency, Bot, Command-Line Tool
- Database, Docker, Emulator/Virtual Machine
- Front-end Framework/Library, Game, Git
- Network Stack, Neural Network, Operating System
- Physics Engine, Programming Language, Regex Engine
- Search Engine, Shell, Template Engine
- Text Editor, Visual Recognition System, Voxel Engine

### Editing Guidelines

- Each tutorial entry follows strict formatting: language in bold, title in italics, with URL
- Video tutorials are marked with `[video]`
- PDF resources are marked with `[pdf]`
- Maintain consistent markdown formatting throughout
- Links must point to high-quality, educational resources

### Content Philosophy

This repository follows the principle: *"What I cannot create, I do not understand"* - Richard Feynman

Only include tutorials that teach by building from first principles, not by using existing frameworks or libraries.
